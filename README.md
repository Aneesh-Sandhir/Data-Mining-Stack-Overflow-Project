# Data Mining Stack Overflow Project (SYS 6018 Final Project)

#### Aneesh Sandhir, Bradley Katcher

This is a copy of the repository my classmates and I put together during a project for our Data Mining Class. 
We looked at evrey question answered by every user on Stack Exchange's statistics focused forum, Cross Validated, with a reputation of more than 10,000 points. By applying a logistic model developed in a previous project we developed features for every user which described each users propensity to answer a given questionbased on some basic features of the questions title body and the tags it was posted with. Additionally, we cast the data into a graph with each node representing a user and links representing questions answered by both users weighted by how frequently two users will answer the same question. Lastly, we applied K-means, Fuzzy or C-means, and Spectral clustering to aggregate these users into groups. 

The markdown and notebook file we put together contain our findings, along with a more detailed description of our methodology, as well as used our findings to identify the user our proffessor most directly competes with for points.
